Welcome to my internship project repository! In this project, I focused on learning and mastering various aspects of React development, including styling React apps with CSS Modules, creating custom React hooks, implementing authentication using Firebase, and managing state with Redux Toolkit.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this internship project was to gain practical experience in building modern web applications using React and incorporating essential features such as user authentication and state management with Redux Toolkit. 

## Key Features

- **React Fundamentals**: Mastered the core concepts of React, including components, state, props, and lifecycles, to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **CSS Modules Styling**: Utilized CSS Modules to create modular, scoped, and reusable styles for React components, ensuring better maintainability and avoiding style conflicts.

- **Custom React Hooks**: Implemented custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic, promoting code organization and reducing duplication across components.

- **Firebase Authentication**: Integrated Firebase Authentication to enable secure user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to the app's functionalities.

- **State Management with Redux Toolkit**: Learned how to manage complex application state efficiently using Redux Toolkit, streamlining the app's data flow and enhancing user experience.
